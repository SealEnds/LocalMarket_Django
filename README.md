1. Guest user (no login): 

See shops and productos

Search products and shops by category

3. Owner User:

Create Products in Shop manually or with csv:

        ref;name;description;price;visible;in_stock
        11100;Producto Uno;Descubre [Nombre del Producto], creado para ofrecerte calidad y rendimiento excepcionales.;10;true;true
        2220;Producto Dos;Descubre [Nombre del Producto], creado para ofrecerte calidad y rendimiento excepcionales.;20;true;false
